# hoxha
A userland rootkit that was meant to be everything <a href="https://github.com/mephistolist/tito">Tito</a> was not. As Enver Hoxha was Tito's next door neighbor and completely diametrically opposed in ideologically, there was no more a fitting name. Hoxha was also known for being very paranoid, so way more detection-evasion was used.
